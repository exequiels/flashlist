**Flashlist collaborative lists, with no registration needed.**

I choose to believe that everything adds up, that I make a difference—even the projects that don't seem to have an apparent impact. To me, they're paths already walked or yet to be walked.

Today, at 41 years old, I launched flashlist.com.ar: a project built with React and Laravel, conceived as an excuse to keep learning while offering an alternative to what's already out there.

Time simply flies. Thank you to my family and all the good vibes people.

I wanted to keeps practicing and a small simple project.

Technologies Used
React, TypeScript, and Laravel
PrimeReact: component library.

Create an `.env` file and add the variables:

```bash
VITE_URL=
VITE_BACKEND_URL=
```

Start it up:

```bash
npm run install
npm run dev
```

You need to set up the backend for all of this to generate the lists. However, you can see a full preview of the list builder in the React part until you click the "Create" button.

Search my repo for the backend.
