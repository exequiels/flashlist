**Flashlist collaborative lists, with no registration needed.**

I choose to believe that everything adds up, that I make a difference—even the projects that don't seem to have an apparent impact. To me, they're paths already walked or yet to be walked.

Today, at 41 years old, I launched flashlist.com.ar: a project built with React and Laravel, conceived as an excuse to keep learning while offering an alternative to what's already out there.

Time simply flies. Thank you to my family and all the good vibes people.

I wanted to keeps practicing and a small simple project.

Technologies Used
React, TypeScript, and Laravel
PrimeReact: component library.

Create an `.env` file and add the variables:

```bash
VITE_URL=
VITE_BACKEND_URL=
```

Start it up:

```bash
npm run install
npm run dev
```

You need to set up the backend for all of this to generate the lists. However, you can see a full preview of the list builder in the React part until you click the "Create" button.

Search my repo for the backend.

<!-- PORTFOLIO_DATA_START
**Stack:** React, TypeScript, PrimeFlex, PrimeReact, Laravel APIs.
**Description:** Flashlist – a shared to-do list that can be completed collaboratively via WhatsApp.
**What I've learned and tested:**
- Client-side React is not SEO-friendly by default, and I struggled to fully understand how SEO works in this setup.
- Real-time features are not free: WebSockets in PHP usually require paid infrastructure or external services.
- I learned that using Laravel purely as an API does not solve SSR or SEO; the frontend is still a client-side rendered application.
- This project reinforced my shift in mindset: today I use AI primarily as a learning and reasoning tool, not just for code generation.
